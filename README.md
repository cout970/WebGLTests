# WebGl tests on kotlin and electron
This project is based on electron-kotlin-template to make multiplatform app in kotlin and web technologies

This is just a test project to experiment with WebGl

The project has a minimal setup to use kotlin electron and WebGl

To run the project use `gradlew buildAndRun`, that will compile the backend and open the electron window, to compile the frontend just use `gradlew buildFrontend`, they are different to use CTRL + R to reload only the frontend
